# About

Batch API (JSR 352) Hands-on Lab developed for JavaOne 2014.


It starts with introducing the core concepts of JSR 352 (Job, Chunk, etc.) and then add features and concpets such as Batchlet, Multi-steps Job, Checkpoints, the JobOperator interface, Listeners and Job Partitioning.


This Lab has been tested on GlassFish 4.0 & 4.1 but should work on any Java EE 7 compatible application server (full platform).


To get started, download the project and check the masterLab.html file (generated from the .adoc files).
